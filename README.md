I write a blog (https://thezonemaster.substack.com/), where I focus on NBA Draft and Analytics content. So far, I've developed five proprietary models:

1) Proprietary Defensive Versatility stat calculated using Entropy.

2) Rookie Scale Contract Model - Calculates how much a team should pay a player for their first contract extension. The Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model is constructed to predict the dependent variable cap_percentage using a set of independent variables. Separate file not included shows how I retrieved the independent variables used for the model.

3) Clustering Models - Clusters players using Kmeans from 2015-16 season to 2020-21 season. Then displayed the flow of these clusters season over season using a Sankey Diagram.

4) Shooting Model - Model leverages shooting indicators on college/international draft prospects to predict career 3-point shooting percentage.

5) Player Tracking System - Used Computer Vision (OpenCV and DeepSort) on YOLO trained model and Homography to map players.
